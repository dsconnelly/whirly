whirly
======

whirly provides easy-to-use Python classes for the spectral solutions of
two-dimensional partial differential equations, especially those related to
fluid dynamics. For example, whirly includes a solver for the two-dimensional
vorticity equation

.. math:: \frac{\partial \zeta}{\partial t} + \mathbf{u} \cdot \nabla \zeta = \frac{1}{\text{Re}}\nabla^2 \zeta

where :math:`\text{Re}` is the Reynolds number. For time-stepping, whirly
implements a fourth-order integrating factor method as outlined in
`Yang et al.Â (2021) <https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S002199912030766X>`__.

See the
`example notebook <https://github.com/dsconnelly/whirly/blob/main/example.ipynb>`__
for a quick demonstration of whirly in action.
